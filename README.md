# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-Using-Vision-Transformer
This repository explores the application of Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for brain tumor segmentation from medical images.

**Highlights:**
Leveraged a well-annotated dataset in COCO format
Implemented patch embedding, transformer blocks, and an advanced upsampling pipeline
Combined Dice Loss and Binary Cross-Entropy for optimization
Achieved a final test accuracy of 94.41% and a Dice Coefficient of 0.382
